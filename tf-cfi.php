                                    	What is "Innovation"? An innovation is one of those things that the society looks at and says, if we make 'this' as a part of our life & work, it will definitely change the way we live & work. Just as energy is the basis of life itself, & ideas the source of innovation, so is innovation the vital spark of all human change, improvement & progress. With this view, a group of 10 jolites started a venture to think & do something out of the box & thus came into existence the "center for innovation" club. A club wher the 'ranchordas' of our college gather & put into practice the brilliant ideas that crop up in there '10 gallon' heads. The birth of this clib in the heart of jolu occured on August 2008, & in these couple of years C.F.I has gone from strength to strength with its members increasing with the advent of time. Its the only club in our campus that is autonomous and not under the control of the union.

                                    <p><strong>Innovation is progress</strong></p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                                    	Thinking innovative ideas is one thing and implementing them is another. But the C.F.I 'is' a club where ideas are 'really' put into practice. All kind of robotics activities are in progress. Students are designing embedded robots as well as manual robots. We jolites are participating in various tech fests in leading institutes like the IITs, NITs etc. In the Mardi Gras fest of our college, a tech fest was conducted by C.F.I where participants of all depatments got actively involved. We all can hope that many more such tech fests are conducted in the near future. Apart from building robots, students with a business acumen are engaging in b-plan activites. Students are 'selling' their brainstorming ideas in b-plan events conducted in IITs, NITs. Besides all these, for the first time in our college, a college radio has been launched, where broadcasting of various college events occur. In west bengal apart from JU no other institute has their own college radio! Jolu, isn't it something that we all should be proud of?
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                                    	Presently C.F.I is flocked by students from all years. The 3rd year comprises of 30 students, 2nd year constitute of 70 students, but it is the 1st year who are leading with 90 students. C.F.I has its own experimental lab & the construction of its building is in progress beside the gym. We all hope that C.F.I be made the R&D department (research & development) of our college.
Thus as a club, C.F.I is encouraging jolu to think differently, break the shackles & come up with new ideas. It is asking jolu to discard 'lath' from its dictionary, remove the monotony of our studies & do something exquisite, entrancing & mesmerising.
